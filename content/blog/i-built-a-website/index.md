Any _true_ project has its' own website, right? Yeah, that's what I thought. So I built a website. 

But that's not where this project starts. It actually started at the Christa McAuliffe Space Center in the Central Elementary in Pleasant Grove, UT. My family and I went to this simulator during a family event. 

From their site:

> [...] the Space Center has been inspiring and influencing the lives of thousands of children in Utah, and beyond. The simulators create an immersive environment where students can envision themselves in roles involving leadership, engineering, science, and more while encountering curriculum based challenges. All while having an unforgettable and exciting time.

I was one of those kids. In the early 2000s, I visited this center as a reward for placing at the District Science fair in my 8th grade year.

Going back to the space center brought memories of my childhood and it was a real blast. I love space; I love science fiction; I love roleplaying. This experience as an adult made me wonder if I could do this at home and make it a weekly 'D&D' style game for my friends and family. I started doing some research and found that the Space Center's software is open source and built by a student at one of the universities in the state. The software is called [Thorium](https://thoriumsim.com/) and is a lot of hand waving. There's no game engine, so it's very open and allows you to do whatever you like within your story. I also found another software called [EmptyEpsilon](https://github.com/daid/EmptyEpsilon) that _is_ a game engine, but not as open as Thorium. I plan on using both of these projects, mixing them together, and building an experience that works!

I have decided to base my experience in the Babylon 5 universe, a universe that I grew up loving. It's vastly unexplored and should provide a unique experience. The ship I'm building is the [EAS Lexington](https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/EAS_Lexington), the only ship to have destroyed a Minbari warship during the Earth-Minbari war. This ship hasn't been seen since that war, but we're bringing it back. It has a bold history, and an even bolder future!

On this site I'll be documenting my work, but I'm also going to rope my brothers into this project. We'll document their progress too. 

Let me know what you think about this project!
